# Frontend Mentor - Launch countdown timer

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

-   See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
-   Set the countdown as needed
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

This project is built using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and moment-js.
